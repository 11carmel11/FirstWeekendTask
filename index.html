            <p><b>Ever wonder who invented the coffee maker? The short answer is Melitta Bentz in 1908.
                 Melitta Bentz created the first drip coffee maker using a filter she made out of blotting paper.</b></p>
            <p>The history of the coffee maker, like many inventions, began long ago. The Turks were known to brew coffee way 
                back in 575 A.D. and the history of the coffee maker really begins there. Much of the history of the coffee maker
                 has been lost to the ages, so no one really knows much about the history of 
                the coffee maker from the time of the Turks to 1818, when the first coffee percolator was created.</p>
